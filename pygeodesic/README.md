# pygeodesic

Python library to compute geodesic distance over a triangular based surface mesh.

A Cython wrapper of the C++ code by [Kirsanov](https://code.google.com/archive/p/geodesic/), which is an implementation of the exact geodesic algorithm for triangular mesh first described by Mitchell, Mount and Papadimitriou in 1987.

`pygeodesic` is similar to other libraries on PyPi (such as [gdist](https://pypi.org/project/gdist/) and [tvb-gdist](https://pypi.org/project/tvb-gdist/)), but:
* provides a wrapper of the GeodesicAlgorithmExact class
* exposes geodesic path (not just geodesic distance)
* licensed under MIT license similar to the orginal Kirsanov C++ code, rather than GPL

A good alternative to `pygeodesic` is [potpourri3d](https://pypi.org/project/potpourri3d/), which uses the *heat method* and *vector heat method* to compute geodesic distance over surfaces and point clouds. However, this library does not currently output the geodesic path on the surface.

## Requirements

A C++ compiler is required if you are not installing one of the precompiled wheels. Although `pygeodesic` is a Cython wrapper, Cython is not required as the cythonized C++ file is also provided.

[VTK](https://pypi.org/project/vtk/) is used for visualisation in the example notebooks.


## Installation

Install from PyPi:
```
pip install pygeodesic
```

Installation from source (from within folder containing `setup.py`):
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Loading pygeodesic:
```python
import pygeodesic.geodesic as geodesic
```

To read the mesh files provided with the original C++ code:
```python
filename = r'data/flat_triangular_mesh.txt'
result = geodesic.read_mesh_from_file(filename)
if result:
    points, faces = result
```

To calculate the geodesic distance and path between two points (the *source* and the *target*) on the mesh:
```python
# Initialise the PyGeodesicAlgorithmExact class instance
geoalg = geodesic.PyGeodesicAlgorithmExact(points, faces)

# Define the source and target point ids with respect to the points array
sourceIndex = 25
targetIndex = 97

# Compute the geodesic distance and the path
distance, path = geoalg.geodesicDistance(sourceIndex, targetIndex)
```

To calculate the geodesic distances from a single point (the source point) to all other points on the mesh:
```python
source_indices = np.array([25])
target_indices = None
distances, best_source = geoalg.geodesicDistances(source_indices, target_indices)
```

To calculate the geodesic distances from two source points to 3 target points:
```python
source_indices = np.array([25,100]) 
target_indices = np.array([0,10,50])
distances, best_source = geoalg.geodesicDistances(source_indices, target_indices)
```

For more detail, a Jupyter notebook is provided in the examples folder to show how to use `pygeodesic` to compute geodesic distances and paths.

## Example using the Stanford Bunny

A Jupyter notebook is provided showing how to use `pygeodesic` to calculate the geodesic distance and path using the Stanford Bunny as an example.
