## Running the Algorithm

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. **Edit Input Paths**  
   Open the `pipeline.py` file and update the paths for the following variables inside the `main()` function:
   - `mesh_file`: Path to your input mesh file.
   - `sample_file`: Path to the file containing indices of the sampled points.

2. **Run the Script**  
   Once the paths are correctly set, run the script from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 pipeline.py

## Requirements

Before running the algorithm, make sure to install all necessary dependencies. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
